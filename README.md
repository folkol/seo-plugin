seo-plugin
==========
Plugin to provide basic SEO techniques (meta-data, sitemap and robots.txt) as settings on Site and Page level for a Polopoly project.

WARNING!
========
Know what you are doing, this plugin was meant to demonstrate how hard it is to provide a plugin that requires changes on site or page level in Polopoly.

This is a source plugin
=======================
You will need to do some customizations to your Polopoly project to get this to work.

TODO's
======
* Need to add better documentation ;)
* Need to add language keys for meta-data
* Some tests would be nice
* Move some classes for better structure
